/// The guard on the one bug class the replay harness is structurally blind to, for the fields the bridge
/// still copies by hand. The PER-WINDOW fields are not among them: a live `Window` stores its
/// `TrackedWindow` (`Window.tracked`), so the bridge hands the whole record over and back.
///
/// `TrackedWindowStateBridge.snapshot()` builds a FRESH `TrackedWindowState()` for every dispatch, so a field
/// it does not repopulate is empty at the start of every input — anything written by one event and read by
/// the next silently never fires. `TestReducerRunner` threads ONE state through a whole scenario and never
/// round-trips it through the bridge, so every replay test stays green while the feature does nothing in the
/// app. Eight fields shipped that way (`offScreen` plus the whole minted-tab handover chain) with 817 tests
/// passing; it took a live capture to notice, twice.
///
/// So every stored property of `TrackedWindowState` must be CLASSIFIED here, and the class it is put in is a
/// claim about how it survives between dispatches:
///
///   - `carried` — the one field with no live-model home. Its own properties are parked wholesale by the
///     bridge, so anything nested inside it is safe by construction. New reducer memory belongs in there.
///   - `projections` — rebuilt from the live model on every snapshot (`Windows.list`, `TabGroups.table`,
///     the `Spaces` topology…). Safe because the model, not the struct, is the source of truth.
///   - `perDispatch` — deliberately fresh each input. Only `now`, which is stamped by the shell.
///
/// Adding a field to `TrackedWindowState` without deciding which of the three it is fails this test. That is
/// the entire point: the decision is cheap, and getting it wrong by DEFAULT is what cost the live iterations.
